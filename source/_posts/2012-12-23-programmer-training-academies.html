<p>Programmers in general, and Rails developers in particular, continue to be in strong demand, and several excellent in-person training courses have sprung up to help meet the need, including <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/WnmFTS">App Academy</a> in San Francisco, <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> (formerly Code Academy) in Chicago, and <a href="http://hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> in New York. (I'm pleased to note that all four have used the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> as part of their curriculum at one time or another.) Such programs typically aren't cheap (although Hacker School is free), but the people I've talked to who  have gone through them say they are a good  investment.</p>
<p>Dev Bootcamp doesn't appear to have any openings right now, but both <a href="http://bit.ly/WnmFTS">App Academy</a> and <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> have openings for their classes starting on January&nbsp;7, and <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> is accepting applications for its winter batch until January&nbsp;1. If you're interested in taking your web development skills to the next level, I recommend checking them out. (<em>Note</em>: While I have no formal relationship with any of the groups mentioned, I know people at all four places, and <a href="http://bit.ly/WnmFTS">App Academy</a> pays referral bonuses if you end up attending.)</p>
