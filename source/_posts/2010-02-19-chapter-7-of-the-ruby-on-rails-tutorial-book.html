<p><a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/sign-up#top">Chapter 7</a> is out. It uses Rails 2.3.5 as before, and I'll keep using Rails 2.3 until at least a Rails 3.0 release candidate (RC) is available, but I have got a nice Rails 3 beta setup running so you can expect an updated tutorial in a <em>very</em> timely manner. :-)</p>
