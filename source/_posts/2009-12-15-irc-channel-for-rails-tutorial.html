<p>Thanks to the efforts of <a href="http://coderpath.com/" target="_self">Miles Forrest</a>, the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> project now has a dedicated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" target="_self">IRC</a> channel! Find it at #railstutorial on irc.freenode.net using your favorite IRC client or at <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=railstutorial" target="_self">http://webchat.freenode.net</a> in your browser. (See <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Started-with-IRC-%28Internet-Relay-Chat%29">this guide</a> if you need help getting started with IRC.) Miles has generously volunteered to oversee the chat room, and I certainly plan to drop by from time to time. I hope people find it useful.</p>
