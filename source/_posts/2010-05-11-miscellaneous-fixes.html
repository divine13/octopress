<p>I've pushed out an updated version of the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book">Ruby on Rails Tutorial book</a> with lots of miscellaneous fixes, mostly due to reader feedback (which continues to be incredibly helpful). Be sure to reload the pages (and optionally <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/downloads/pdf">download the PDF</a> after clearing your browser cache) to get the freshest version.</p>
<p>By the way, I usually deploy a new version of the tutorial several times a week, and sometimes several times a day, so the above procedure is probably a good habit to get into. (A little late to tell you, I know. :-) I've added a note to the sidebar of each page (e.g., <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book">here</a>) to make it easier to tell when the tutorial was last updated.</p>
