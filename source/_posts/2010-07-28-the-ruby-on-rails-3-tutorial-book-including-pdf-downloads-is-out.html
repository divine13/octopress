title: The Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial book (including PDF downloads) is out
published: true
---
<p>I'm pleased to announce the availability of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/?discount=railstutorial01"><em>Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial</em> book</a>, a version of the <em>Rails Tutorial</em> book fully up-to-date with Rails 3.0. As always, the book is available for free <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book">online</a>, and as of today it is also available for purchase as a <a href="http://railstutorial.org/?discount=railstutorial01#buy">PDF download</a>. In addition to the <em>Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial</em> book, all purchases include a free copy of the <em>Ruby on Rails 2.3 Tutorial</em> book as well. Since Rails 3.0 is still under development, you'll also get free PDF updates through the final version of Rails 3.0. (As part of this release, the default version of the tutorial has switched over to Rails 3.0. If you want to read the Rails 2.3 tutorial online, you can use the version switcher in the book's sidebar or use <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book?version=2.3">this direct link</a>.)</p>
<p>As a thank-you to all the readers who contributed to the book by reporting bugs and typos, the links in this news announcement contain a code for a 20% discount on the PDFs, good for 30 days. If you prefer to use the code directly, it is <tt>railstutorial01</tt>.</p>
<p>I'm also happy to announce that a print edition, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321743121?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwrailst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321743121"><em>Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example</em></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httpwwwrailst-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321743121" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />, is due out in the fall as part of the <a href="http://www.informit.com/promotions/promotion.aspx?promo=135393">Professional Ruby Series</a> (the same series as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601661?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwrailst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321601661"><em>The Rails 3 Way</em></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httpwwwrailst-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601661" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> by Obie Fernandez). It is currently available for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321743121?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwrailst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321743121">pre-order at Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httpwwwrailst-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321743121" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />.</p>
<p>Finally, I am very excited to announce that, after the Rails 3 ecosystem and book text have fully stabilized, the HTML source of the online version will be available under a Creative Commons license to allow for translation into other languages. Readers interested in serving as translators should email me at my personal address, which is available through <a href="http://michaelhartl.com/contact">my contact page</a>.</p>
<p>To make it easier to spread the word about the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/?discount=railstutorial01">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> project, I've added a Facebook Like button to the site (and to each news post). If you genuinely like the book, I'd appreciate it if you took the time to <a href="http://railstutorial.org/?discount=railstutorial01">click on the Like button</a> when you get the chance. (If you don't like the book, I'm afraid you're out of luck until Facebook comes out with a Dislike button.)</p>
<p>Thanks again to all the <em>Rails Tutorial</em> readers who offered their support, encouragement, and feedback. I couldn't have done it without you.</p>
