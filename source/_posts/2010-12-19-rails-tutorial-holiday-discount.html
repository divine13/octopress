<p>I'm pleased to announce the Rails Tutorial Holiday Discount! The coupon code</p>
<p><tt style="font-size: 100%;">rubynose</tt></p>
<p>will get you 15% off any combination of <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> products. Act fast, though&mdash;this offer expires as soon as Santa Claus and Rudolph the Ruby-Nosed Reindeer are done with their work, which I estimate will be at 3&nbsp;a.m. PST on December 25. (Tragically, right now <a href="http://northpole.com/">northpole.com</a> appears to use Microsoft Active Server Pages. Someday, maybe we'll manage to get Santa on Rails! :-)</p>
