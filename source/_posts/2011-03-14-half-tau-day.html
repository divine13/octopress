<p>This is a quick follow-up to <a href="http://news.railstutorial.org/ruby-and-the-tau-manifesto">Ruby and <em>The Tau Manifesto</em></a> from last June 28 (6/28, or <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a>). Today is "Pi Day", and in honor of &pi; still being wrong I'm pleased to announce the new site <a href="http://halftauday.com/">Half Tau Day</a>, which describes the &tau;ist version of this famously &pi;ous holiday. Today also marks the appearance of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/03/14/pi.tau.math/">an article about tau on CNN.com</a> called <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/03/14/pi.tau.math/">On Pi Day, is 'pi' under attack?</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG7vhMMXagQ">an awesome video</a> called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG7vhMMXagQ">"Pi is (still) wrong"</a> by 'mathemusician' <a href="http://vihart.com/">Vi Hart</a>.</p>
<p>As with <a href="http://tauday.com/"><em>The Tau Manifesto</em></a>, the <a href="http://halftauday.com/">Half Tau Day</a> site is a Rails app running on <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> behind a <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-caching">Varnish cache</a>. This is probably overkill for such a simple site, but Rails application generation and deployment is now so easy that there's not much reason <em>not</em> to use Rails, and running a full Rails stack ensures that <a href="http://halftauday.com/">halftauday.com</a> can grow and evolve to meet any future requirements, no matter what they might be.</p>
<p>The &pi; is a lie&hellip; Happy <a href="http://halftauday.com/">Half Tau Day</a>!</p>
