title: Rails Tutorial book (online vs. PDF)

<p>Regarding the recent <a href="http://news.railstutorial.org/upgrade-to-rails-306">changes to the <em>Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> due to the release of <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/4/6/rails-3-0-6-has-been-released">Rails&nbsp;3.0.6</a>, one reader asked if the changes applied only to the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book">online book</a> or if the PDF book has been updated as well. This is a reasonable question; the answer is that both versions of the book are produced from the same source file, so they are <em>always</em> in sync by construction. If you purchased the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> PDF</a> or the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy"> PDF/screencast bundle</a>,  simply search through your mail program for "Ruby on Rails Tutorial purchase" and visit the original PDF download link to get the latest version of the book.</p>
