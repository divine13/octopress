title: Testing tools and an important note for Ruby 1.9 users
published: true
---
<p>I've just deployed a rewrite of <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/static-pages#sec:testing_tools">Section&nbsp;2.2.1</a>, which deals with the testing tools used in the Rails Tutorial book. In addition to general clarification, I added a critically important step for any readers using Ruby&nbsp;1.9. I'm grateful for the reader feedback that identified an interaction issue between Ruby&nbsp;1.9 and the most recent version of RSpec: if you're using Ruby&nbsp;1.9 or plan to upgrade soon, be sure to see the note on <tt>Test::Unit</tt> in the section on <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/static-pages#sec:installing_rspec">Installing RSpec</a>. And <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/feedback">let me know</a> if you have any comments or run into any problems in the rewritten section.</p>
