<p>The <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> project has benefited from the enthusiastic recommendations of readers of the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> and viewers of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/#buy">Rails Tutorial screencast series</a>. I'm pleased to announce the introduction of an <a href="http://railstutorial.org/affiliates">affiliate program</a> to reward people for spreading the word about the Rails Tutorial book &amp; screencasts.</p>
<p>To sign up as an affiliate, go to the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/affiliates">Ruby on Rails Tutorial Affiliate Program page</a> and follow the instructions there. After creating your account, you will get a custom affiliate link that sets a cookie on the user's browser and then redirects to the main <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> page. If the user makes a purchase within 60 days of clicking the link, you will receive a <strong>50% commission</strong> on the sale of any combination of Rails Tutorial products.</p>
<p>This project owes much of its success to good word-of-mouth from people like you. Thanks again for your enthusiastic support of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial!</p>
