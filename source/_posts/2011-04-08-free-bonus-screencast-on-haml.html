title: Free bonus screencast on Haml
published: true
---
<p>As a free bonus to buyers of the <a href="http://amzn.to/RTbook">print edition of the <em>Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial</em></a> (as well as to anyone who buys any products <a href="http://railstutorial.org/#buy">directly from the Rails Tutorial website</a>), I have made a special informal screencast on <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">Haml</a>, an awesome templating language that is a drop-in replacement for Embedded Ruby. The video runs nearly an hour and covers most of the basics of Haml, including installation, syntax, and even some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotcha_%28programming%29">gotchas</a>.</p>
<p>Purchasers of the print edition should enter their contact information at the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/haml">bonus screencast page</a>, together with a piece of information whose answer appears in the book. Purchasers of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/#buy">PDF</a> or <a href="http://railstutorial.org/#buy">screencasts</a> should check their email for a special message or check their original download page for a special link.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this bonus screencast!</p>
