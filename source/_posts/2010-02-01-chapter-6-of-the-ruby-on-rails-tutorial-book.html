title: Chapter 6 of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial book
published: true

<p>A draft of <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/modeling-and-viewing-users-two#top">Chapter 6</a> of the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> is out. Enjoy!</p>
<p>By the way, Rails 3 is due out any day now; as soon as I verify that all the book (and gem/plugin) code works, I'll convert the tutorial over to use Rails&nbsp;3, and future chapters should be Rails&nbsp;3&ndash;compatible from the start. (The switch to Rails 3 will temporarily break the <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> deploys in the tutorial, but worry not&mdash;they are hard at work and will be supporting Rails 3 soon.) For current readers, the Rails&nbsp;3 switch will probably mean working quickly through the tutorial a second time to update your code; I will be modifying the tutorial slightly to make this second run-through a little easier. Of course, I'll make a separate news announcement when the Rails&nbsp;3&ndash;compatible tutorial is ready.</p>
