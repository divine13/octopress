title: Deploying to Heroku with Rails 3.0.0.rc
published: true

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This issue has now been fixed.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> uses the latest version of Rails, which is the current release candidate of Rails 3.0.0.rc. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, you can't deploy applications to Heroku using the Rails release candidate because of a conflict with the latest version of Bundler. See <a href="http://blog.mhartl.com/2010/07/28/deploying-to-heroku-with-rails-3-0-0-rc/">this blog post</a> for a possible workaround.</p>
