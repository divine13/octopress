title: Rails Tutorial book update
published: true
---
<p>I've updated the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> to use the latest version of Rails&nbsp;3.0 (3.0.9 as of today) in preparation for the upcoming release of a short supplementary chapter (and screencast) on Rails&nbsp;3.1. There are lots of miscellaneous changes in this update of the book, including new versions of RSpec, Spork, and RubyGems itself. To update your sample application, take a look at <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/updating-showing-and-deleting-users#code:final_gemfile">the sample app's updated Gemfile</a> or <a href="https://github.com/railstutorial/sample_app">the full sample app on GitHub</a>.</p>
