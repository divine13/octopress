<p>I've updated the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/static-pages#sec:spork">section on Spork</a> in the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> to use the new <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/spork">Spork release candidate</a>, which works with Rails&nbsp;3. There are several changes to the sample app config files; see the <a href="https://github.com/railstutorial/sample_app/commit/572ec86da3017043cdf254d3134088245c3192e0">commit at GitHub</a> for the details (or clone the <a href="https://github.com/railstutorial/sample_app">sample app repo</a>). <em>Note:</em> Peter Cooper has a <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/how-to-rails-3-and-rspec-2-4336.html">post on Rails, RSpec, and Spork</a> that has an extra line (<tt>config.cache_classes = false</tt> in <tt>config/environments/test.rb</tt>) that I don't find necessary; please <a href="mailto:admin@railstutorial.org">let me know</a> if your experience is different.</p>
