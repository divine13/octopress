<p>In the last couple days, several readers have let me know that they have nominated the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial project</a> for a <a href="http://rubyheroes.com/">Ruby Hero</a> award; I am suprised and flattered by these nominations. Although Rails Tutorial is not a charity&mdash;I hope to make it a sustainable enterprise through screencast sales and possible online classes&mdash;it was born of a desire to make Ruby on Rails web development accessible to as broad an audience as possible. If you feel that Rails Tutorial deserves recognition as a Ruby Hero, I encourage you to submit the project's main URL (i.e., <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/"><tt>http://www.railstutorial.org/</tt></a>) at the <a href="http://rubyheroes.com/">Ruby Hero Awards website</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. Chapter 9 is coming very soon. :-)</p>
