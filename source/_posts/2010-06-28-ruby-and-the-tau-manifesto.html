title: Ruby and the Tau Manifesto

<p>Many of you are probably aware of "Pi Day", an annual celebration of the number π (pi) that takes place on March 14 (3/14). Some of you may also be aware that there are serious problems with π, which is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. This definition is in many ways a confusing and unnatural choice for the circle constant. I have just launched a new project called <a href="http://tauday.com/">The Tau Manifesto</a>, which argues in favor of the <em>true</em> circle constant, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its <em>radius</em>, and proposes that we call this number τ (tau). And, since numerically τ is 2π, you might note that today is June 28 (6/28)—that is, today is <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Tau Manifesto</em> was written using the same typesetting system (which I call PolyTeXnic) used to write the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> book, and PolyTeXnic itself is written in Ruby. I hope the more mathematically inclined Rubyists out there will be interested to read the <em>Tau Manifesto</em>, which can be found at <a href="http://tauday.com/">tauday.com</a>.</p>
<p>Happy Tau Day!</p>
