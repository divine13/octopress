title: Affiliate program quick clarification

<p>I have a quick clarification regarding <a href="http://news.railstutorial.org/rails-tutorial-affiliate-program" title="affiliate post" target="_self">this post</a>: you get a commission on any sale made within 60 days of a user <em>clicking on your affiliate link</em>, not within 60 days of this announcement. In particular, if someone clicks on your link and then clicks again ten days later, the clock gets reset, so any sale within 60 days of the <em>second</em> click will earn you a commission.</p>
