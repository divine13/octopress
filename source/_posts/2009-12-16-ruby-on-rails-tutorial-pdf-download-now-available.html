<p>As some of you may already have seen on the recent <a href="http://bit.ly/6dvDs2">Rails Inside post about <em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em></a>, the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/downloads/pdf">Ruby on Rails Tutorial book PDF</a> is now available for download! It's still only chapters 1&ndash;4, of course, but I'll be keeping it in sync with the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book">web version of the book</a> from now on.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/downloads/pdf">Ruby on Rails Tutorial PDF</a> will be available for free until the book is done (and possibly even after it's done, depending on the circumstances).</p>
