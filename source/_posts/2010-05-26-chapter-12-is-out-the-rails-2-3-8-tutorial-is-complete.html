published: true

<p>I've just released <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/following-users#top">Chapter 12: Following users</a>, thus completing the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book?version=2.3.8">Rails 2.3.8 version of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>. (Of course, this chapter is only a draft; as usual, I appreciate feedback and corrections.) I will soon be turning my attention to the Rails 3 version of the book, as well as starting work on the associated <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/screencasts">Ruby on Rails Tutorial screencast series</a>. Finally, I expect to be making a special announcement some time in the next couple weeks, so stay tuned. (If you haven't done so already, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/railstutorial">subscribe to the news feed</a> to make sure you get it. :-)</p>
