title: Rails Tutorial sample screencast video (timely feedback requested)
published: true
---
<p>I'm gearing up for production on the second edition of the Rails Tutorial screencasts, and I've posted a sample video showing the setup I'm planning to use. I'm going to start screencasting within a few days, so now's your chance to give me feedback (at <a href="mailto:admin@railstutorial.org">admin@railstutorial.org</a>) before the screencast train leaves the station.</p>
<p>Here's the sample video:</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've also included a second video at a slightly different resolution.</p>
<p>These are some of the items I'd like to get feedback on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video.</strong> Is the video crisp? Are the size and format OK?</li>
<li><strong>Sound.</strong> Is the sound clear? Is the volume good?</li>
<li><strong>Screen resolution.</strong> The video's resolution is 1344x756, which uses the standard HD aspect ratio of 16:9 while still fitting on the screen of my MacBook Air. Let me know if it doesn't look good on your system. (If this resolution doesn't work, I might have to buy a new computer, which I'd really rather avoid&hellip;)</li>
<li><strong>Applications and workflow.</strong> I'm planning to use iTerm and Sublime Text as the principal development tools. I'm 95% likely to stick with those, but let me know if you violently disagree with either choice. <em>Note</em>: The main reason for switching to Sublime Text from TextMate (the editor used in the first edition) is that it's comparably good while also being cross-platform.</li>
<li>The video includes some other details, so please watch it all the way through if you're planning to comment. (It's about 11 minutes long.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other observations or suggestions are greatly appreciated (<a href="mailto:admin@railstutorial.org">admin@railstutorial.org</a>), especially if they arrive within the next couple of days. Thanks!</p>
