<p>As part of gearing up for full screencast production and as a teaser for what's to come, I've made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEWtc2nTwCQ">short screencast</a> with a special behing-the-scenes look at how I produce both the Rails Tutorial sample app and the Rails Tutorial book itself. You can find it on YouTube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEWtc2nTwCQ">here</a>. (For best viewing, increase the resolution to HD and run it in full-screen mode.)</p>
