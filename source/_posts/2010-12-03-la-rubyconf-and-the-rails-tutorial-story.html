title: LA RubyConf and the Rails Tutorial Story
published: true
---
<p>I'd like to invite any and all readers/watchers/followers of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial book and screencasts</a> to join me at <a href="http://www.larubyconf.com">LA&nbsp;RubyConf</a> on Saturday, February&nbsp;5th, 2011 in San Pedro, California. I'm planning to present one-day Rails tutorials on each of the tutorial days (February&nbsp;3 &amp;&nbsp;4), and I also hope to give a talk at the main conference on the&nbsp;5th. On this last point, you can even help me out&hellip;</p>
<p>One of the speaking slots for the conference will go to the talk with the most "likes" on the LA&nbsp;RubyConf website. With your help, that talk could be mine. :-) (<strong>Note:</strong> You do <em>not</em> need to attend the conference to vote on the proposal, and the talks will be recorded by <a href="http://confreaks.net/">Confreaks</a>, so even if you don't attend you can still watch the talk online.) Here are the steps to vote for my talk proposal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="http://www.larubyconf.com/users/new">LA RubyConf signup page</a> and sign up as a new user.</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="http://www.larubyconf.com/proposals/25">"Rails Tutorial Story" proposal page</a> and click <strong>like</strong> at the bottom of the talk summary.</li>
<li>There is no step 3!</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, you can "like" the talk proposal even if you don't come to the conference, but I certainly hope you will. Los Angeles is beautiful in February&mdash;and 100% snow-free. :-)</p>
