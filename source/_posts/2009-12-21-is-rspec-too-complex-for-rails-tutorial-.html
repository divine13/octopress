title: Is RSpec too complex for Rails Tutorial?
published: true
---
<p>I've gotten feedback that RSpec may be too complex for the Rails Tutorial book. Though I mainly use RSpec myself, there are advantages to using the default Test::Unit framework. If I'm ever going to switch from RSpec to Test::Unit, now is the time, since subsequent chapters will have many more tests and would require much more rewriting to change. I've set up a survey to get reader feedback about testing frameworks; please let me know what you think by taking the survey <a href="http://mhartl.wufoo.com/forms/rails-tutorial-survey/">here</a>.</p>
