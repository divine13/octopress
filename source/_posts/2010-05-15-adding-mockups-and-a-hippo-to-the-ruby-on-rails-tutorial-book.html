title: Adding mockups (and a hippo) to the Ruby on Rails Tutorial book
published: true
---
<p>I've added a bunch of mockups (made using the excellent <a href="http://gomockingbird.com/">Mockingbird wireframing application</a>) to <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/filling-in-the-layout#top">Chapters 5â€“11</a> of the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book">Ruby on Rails Tutorial book</a>. As with real-life mockups, the book mockups help motivate the HTML interface by giving a preview of what is to come. They also serve as a gentler introduction to some of the more test-heavy sections of the book. Plus, they gave me a chance to include pictures of a <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/modeling-and-viewing-users-one#fig:profile_mockup">hippo</a> and a <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/sign-in-sign-out#fig:signin_success_mockup">shark</a> in the tutorial, among other <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/sign-up#fig:signup_success_mockup">things</a>, and it's hard to argue with that. <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/filling-in-the-layout#top">Check them out</a> when you get the chance!</p>
