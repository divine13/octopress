title: Oy vey, a Rails 2.3.8 update already
published: true

<p>It looks like they jumped the gun with Rails 2.3.7; <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/5/25/ruby-on-rails-2-3-8-released">Rails 2.3.8</a> has already been released. Yet again, the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> has been updated as well.</p>
<p>Today one reader <a href="https://twitter.com/rs838/status/14649318161">suggested via Twitter</a> the following idea:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Sell the book with just a box for the version, a pencil and eraser so readers can change the version each day.</blockquote>
<p>Let's hope it doesn't come to that!</p>
<p>P.S. Chapter 12 is coming soon. :-)</p>
