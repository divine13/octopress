title: A new Chapter 2 for Ruby on Rails Tutorial
published: true
---
<p>Based on reader feedback, I have added a new chapter to <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>: <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/a-demo-app#top">Chapter 2: A demo app</a>. This new chapter presents a high-level overview of Rails, including a discussion of MVC, REST, and the Rails class hierarchies. As part of this change, I've rewritten parts of <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/beginning#top">Chapter 1</a>, which now creates a "first app" instead of the sample app used in <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/static-pages#top">Chapter 3</a> and beyond. <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/a-demo-app#top">Chapter 2</a> then creates a second "demo app" for use in the overview. One nice consequence of this is that each of the first three chapters now includes the full arc of application creation (<tt>rails</tt> command, Git repo initialization, etc.), which should serve to reinforce that important process for new readers.</p>
<p>By the way, the insertion of a new Chapter 2 means that the numbers of all subsequent chapters have increased by one. Luckily, I anticipated this possibility, and my typesetting system uses permalinks almost exclusively, so that (for example) links to <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/sign-up#top">what used to be Chapter 7</a> now automatically link to <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/sign-up#top">Chapter 8</a> instead. (Only links for the occasional sub- or subsubsection will break, and I doubt many people have linked to those.)</p>
<p>In other news, I expect to release a new branch of the tutorial soon, a version designed to use Rails 3 throughout. Initially, it will not be fully compatible with Rails 3, but that's what the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/brigade_members/new">Rails 3 Tutorial Brigade</a> is for; I'll be relying on the intrepid Brigade readers to help me ferret out the many changes necessary to make <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> the most up-to-date introduction to Rails available.</p>
