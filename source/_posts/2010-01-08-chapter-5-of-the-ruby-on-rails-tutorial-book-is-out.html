<p><a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/modeling-and-viewing-users-one#top">Chapter 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book">Ruby on Rails Tutorial book</a> is now available. I've also released a <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/beginning#sec:introduction">rewritten introduction</a> and added a <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/beginning#sec:MVC">section on the model-view-controller architecture</a>.</p>
<p>So far I've been impressed with both the quantity and quality of feedback on <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Rails Tutorial</a>. As before, any <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/feedback">comments, suggestions, or corrections</a> are much appreciated.</p>
