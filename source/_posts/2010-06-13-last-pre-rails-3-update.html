<p>I've just added some class inheritance diagrams to <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/rails-flavored-ruby#top">Chapter 4</a> of the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book">Ruby on Rails Tutorial book</a>, which I expect will be the last substantive update to the Rails 2.3 tutorial. Starting next week, I'll be turning my full attention to the Rails 3 version of the book. See you on the other side. :-)</p>
