title: Rails Tutorial & Rails 3.1
published: true

<p>As part of the effort to keep the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> up-to-date with the latest version of Rails, I am pleased to announce the availability of a <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/rails-3-1">special new chapter on Rails 3.1</a> (which is currently available as a <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/5/22/rails-3-1-release-candidate">release candidate</a>). You can find the new <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/rails-3-1">Ruby on Rails&nbsp;3.1 tutorial chapter online here</a>.</p>
<p>The Rails Tutorial PDF has also been updated, and I have produced an accompanying Rails 3.1 screencast, which is now included with the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy">purchase of the full screencast series or PDF/screencast bundle</a>. (Everyone who already bought the PDF or screencast series should check their inboxes for a free update. The download pages have been updated as well, so you can also search for "Your Ruby on Rails Tutorial purchase" in your email client.)</p>
<p>A future edition of the Rails Tutorial book and screencast series will of course use Rails&nbsp;3.1 (or its successor) from the start. Look for an announcement later this year.</p>
