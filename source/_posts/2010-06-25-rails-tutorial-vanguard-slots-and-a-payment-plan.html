title: Rails Tutorial Vanguard slots, and a payment plan
published: true
---
<p>One member of the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/vanguard">Rails Tutorial Vanguard</a> requested paying in monthly installments, and that sounded like a good idea, so I've implemented it for everyone: membership in the Vanguard is now available for three payments of $165. But in order to keep the Vanguard as small as possible, there are only <strong>two places</strong> left, so act quickly while supplies last. You can sign up for the Vanguard <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/vanguard">here</a>.</p>
<p>Given my present rate of progress through the RailsÂ 3 tutorial update, I anticipate that the Vanguard will start in earnest some time soon after the 4th of July holiday break. I hope to see you there!</p>
