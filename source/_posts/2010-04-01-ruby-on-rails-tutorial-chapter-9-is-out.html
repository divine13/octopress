title: Ruby on Rails Tutorial Chapter 9 is out
published: true
---
<p>I've just released a draft of <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em></a> <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/updating-showing-and-deleting-users#top">Chapter 9</a> ("Updating, showing, and deleting users"). It covers the last of the REST actions for the Users resource (<tt>edit</tt>, <tt>update</tt>, <tt>index</tt>, and <tt>destroy</tt>), as well as authorization before filters, sample data generation, and pagination.  This release also includes small updates to <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/sign-up#top">Chapter 7</a> and <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/sign-in-sign-out#top">Chapter 8</a>, fixing a minor issue involving <a>RSpec message expectations</a>.</p>
<p>As noted in my post on the <a href="http://news.railstutorial.org/the-rails-3-tutorial-plan">Rails 3 tutorial plan</a>, Rails 3 (and its associated ecosystem) is not yet stable enough for use in an introductory tutorial. (<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/4/1/rails-3-0-second-beta-release">Rails 3 beta 2</a> was just released today, so they're getting there&hellip; :-) As a result, <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/updating-showing-and-deleting-users#top">Chapter 9</a> continues with its use of Rails 2.3.5. Readers interested in helping with the upcoming Rails 3 upgrade should join the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/brigade_members/new">Rails 3 Tutorial Brigade</a>.</p>
