<p>I am pleased to announce the immediate availability of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/screencasts">Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial screencast series</a>! The series includes 12 individual videos totaling more than 15 hours, with one lesson for each chapter of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial</em> book</a>. The screencasts also contain dozens of tips and tricks to help you go beyond the book, including debugging hints, test-driven development techniques, and solutions to many of the book's exercises. You can find out more about the screencasts here:</p>

<p>I particularly recommend the PDF/screencast bundle, which I think is already a great value, and I'm happy to offer an additional 10% discount using the following code:</p>
<p><tt>rtscreencasts</tt></p>
<p>You should apply this discount code on the checkout page to get your 10% discount. The <tt>rtscreencasts</tt> code expires at the end of the month.</p>
<p>The Rails Tutorial screencasts, together with the Rails Tutorial book, represent the culmination of nearly a year of effort. I hope you have the chance to <a href="http://railstutorial.org/screencasts">take a look at the screencasts</a>; if you decide to buy the screencast series or the PDF/screencast bundle, don't forget to apply the code <tt>rtscreencasts</tt> on the checkout page to get your 10% discount. Most of all, if you do buy the screencasts, I hope you enjoy them!</p>
<p>P.S. Someone submitted the screencast announcement story to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> before I had the chance. This is always a good sign, but unfortunately the title ("Rails tutorial screencasts") is rather generic and could apply to lots of other products. You can help spread the word about <em>the</em> <a href="http://railstutorial.org/screencasts">Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial screencast series</a> by <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1784463">upvoting this story instead</a>. Thanks!</p>
