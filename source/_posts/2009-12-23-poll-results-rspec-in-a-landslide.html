title: ! 'Poll results: RSpec in a landslide'

<p>The poll results are in: after nearly 90 votes, it's <a href="http://mhartl.wufoo.com/reports/rails-tutorial/">RSpec in a landslide</a>. A full 76 of 87 respondents (87.36%) prefer RSpec for use in the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book</a>. This is good news for me, since I know RSpec better, and I also have the specs through Chapter&nbsp;6 already written. For those who voted for <tt>Test::Unit</tt>, I hope you'll come along for the RSpec ride; even though it's not currently the default, I believe <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> is the Rails Way*, so these results are good news for you, too.</p>
<p>To make the introduction to RSpec a little gentler, I'll plan to add some more introductory information in Chapter&nbsp;2, perhaps including a separate box on RSpec or a section on "anatomy of a spec".  If you still run into any RSpec confusion, please <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/feedback">let me know</a>, and I'll do what I can to alleviate it.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">*The <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda">Shoulda</a> testing framework is a good alternate choice&mdash;the Other Rails Way, as it were.</span></p>
