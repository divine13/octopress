<p>GitHub recently changed how they <a href="https://github.com/blog/1105-an-easier-way-to-create-repositories">create new repositories</a>, so the Rails Tutorial book has been updated accordingly. PDF purchasers can get the updated version from their downloads page. (You might have to clear your browser cache first.) The Lesson 3 screencast, currently in preparation, will also show the updated new repository page.</p>
