<p>According to its website, "The <a href="http://coderpath.com/">coderpath podcast</a> is a talk show with a bias toward the Ruby programming language, working on projects, business, and geeking out." I finally got a chance to listen to the <a href="http://coderpath.com/posts/14">coderpath interview about the Rails Tutorial project</a>, and I think hosts <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/milesforrest">Miles Forrest</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/curtismchale">Curtis McHale</a> did a great job. I recommend listening to it if you're curious about the origins of the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> project, and I also discuss some of the projects I hope to do in the future. You can listen to it online <a href="http://coderpath.com/posts/14">here</a> or download it directly <a href="http://www.archive.org/download/Coderpath14-MichaelHartlAndTheRubyOnRailsTutorial/Coderpath14-MichaelHartl.mp3">here</a>.</p>
