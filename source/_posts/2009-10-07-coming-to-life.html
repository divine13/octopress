title: Coming to life

<p>After a busy few months filled with travel and contract work, I've finally been able to give the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> project the attention it deserves, and now it's really coming to life. As a first step, I've written a markup system to make the Rails Tutorial book available simultaneously as HTML and as a PDF; you can see an example of the markup system (which I call PolyTeXnic) in this <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/sample">short sample document</a>. I've also started writing the main book, and will soon start releasing some chapters to the public. Of course, this is only the beginning&mdash;expect to see many exciting announcements here in the coming weeks and months!</p>
