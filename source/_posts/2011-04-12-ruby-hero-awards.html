<p>Nominations are open for the <a href="http://rubyheroes.com/">Ruby Hero Awards</a>:</p>
<blockquote>[Ruby Heroes] create educational content, develop plugins &amp; gems, contribute to open source projects, and even put on events which help educate and make our lives as developers easier&hellip; <a href="http://rubyheroes.com/">Ruby Heroes</a> was created to show some gratitude and give these people the recognition they deserve.</blockquote>
<p>Ruby Heroes is not a popularity contest&mdash;as far as I know, the number of nominations doesn't affect who is selected as a Ruby Hero&mdash;but having lots of nominations surely can't hurt. I've nominated RSpec lead developer Dave Chelimsky (via his GitHub username, <tt>dchelimsky</tt>), and if you use RSpec I encourage you to do the same.</p>
<p>In addition, while it would be a bit gauche for me to nominate myself, I'm not above soliciting nominations, so if any readers/viewers of the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> would like to nominate me, I would be honored. (My GitHub username is <tt>mhartl</tt>.) I was nominated last year and didn't win, but that was before the release of the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">free online Ruby on Rails tutorial book</a>, so this year the results might be different.</p>
