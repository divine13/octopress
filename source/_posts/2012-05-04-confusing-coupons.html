<p>A commenter at Hacker News noted that there have been a lot (perhaps too many) Rails Tutorial coupon codes recently. I may have gotten carried away with this last one, but I hate DRM so much that I really wanted to do something about it. Please email me directly (<a href="mailto:admin@railstutorial.org">admin@railstutorial.org</a>) if you have any complaints and I'll do what it takes to make things right.</p>
