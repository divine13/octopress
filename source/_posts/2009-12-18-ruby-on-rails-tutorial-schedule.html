title: Ruby on Rails Tutorial schedule

<p>This is just a quick heads-up on the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> schedule. I'm leaving tomorrow for a holiday trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairbanks,_Alaska">Very Far Away from Anywhere, Alaska</a>, so writing progress will be slow until the new year. Once I get back, I should be able to move forward fairly quickly: Chapter 5 was getting too big, so I cleaved it neatly in two, and now I have a good start on both Chapters 5 and 6. I hope to release them in January, and then try to keep up a 1&ndash;2 chapter per month pace until the book is done. Of course, I'll announce the availability of each chapter as it's released, both here and on the <a href="http://twitter.com/railstutorial">Rails Tutorial Twitter account</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, the <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/railstutorial">feedback</a> so far has been both encouraging and very helpful. Thanks to everyone who's take the time to write in!</p>
